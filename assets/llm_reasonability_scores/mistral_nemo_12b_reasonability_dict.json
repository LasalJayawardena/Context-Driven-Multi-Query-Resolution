            "reasonability_score": "9" ,"explanation": "Both SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) are techniques used for explaining machine learning models, but they have some key differences. SHAP is based on cooperative game theory and Shapley values, providing a unified measure of feature importance. It considers all possible feature combinations, making it theoretically sound and consistent, but can be computationally expensive due to the need to evaluate many combinations. SHAP provides both global and local interpretability, offering insights into the model as a whole and individual predictions. In the ISee Platform, you can explore SHAP-based explainers such as '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPLocal' for tabular data, which provide global and local feature influence explanations respectively.\\n\\nOn the other hand, LIME focuses on local interpretability by approximating the model with a simpler, interpretable model around a specific prediction. It uses perturbations of the input data to understand the model's behavior in the vicinity of a particular instance. LIME is generally faster than SHAP as it does not require evaluating all feature combinations, but may not provide as consistent results due to its reliance on local approximations. The ISee Platform offers LIME-based explainers such as '/Tabular/LIME' for tabular data, which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance.\\n\\nBoth methods aim to make AI models more transparent and understandable, but the choice between them depends on the specific needs for interpretability and computational resources. You can try out these explainers on the ISee Platform to better understand their functionalities."
