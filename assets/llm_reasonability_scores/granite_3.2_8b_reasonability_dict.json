The main differences lie in their approach and output:\\n\\n1. Approach: SHAP is based on cooperative game theory, attributing the prediction of a model to each feature by considering all possible combinations. LIME, on the other hand, approximates the local behavior of complex models with interpretable models, such as linear or decision trees.\\n\\n2. Output: SHAP provides both global and local explanations, showing the contribution of each feature to the prediction for individual instances (local) and across the entire dataset (global). LIME generates local explanations by approximating the model's behavior around a specific instance with an interpretable model."
