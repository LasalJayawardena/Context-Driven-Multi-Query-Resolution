            "reasonability_score": "8" ,"explanation": "Here are some alternative explainability techniques that can be used instead of the current method:\\n    1. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Provides a unified measure of feature importance based on cooperative game theory. The ISee Platform includes several SHAP explainers such as '/Images/KernelSHAP' and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal', which users can try out to visualize feature importance through saliency maps and feature influence explanations.\\n    2. DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures): Assigns importance scores to each input feature by comparing the activation of each neuron to a reference activation. While the ISee Platform does not have a specific DeepLIFT explainer, users can explore similar techniques like '/Images/RISE' and '/Images/GradCam' for saliency maps.\\n    3. Integrated Gradients: Computes the integral of gradients of the model's output with respect to the inputs along the path from a baseline to the input. The ISee Platform offers gradient-based techniques such as '/Images/GradientInput' and '/Images/SmoothGrad' for generating saliency maps.\\n    4. Anchor Explanations: Provides high-precision rules (anchors) that sufficiently explain the behavior of the model for a particular instance. Users can explore the '/Tabular/Anchors' explainer on the ISee Platform to generate anchor explanations for tabular data.\\n    5. Counterfactual Explanations: Identifies minimal changes to the input that would change the model's prediction to a desired output. The ISee Platform includes counterfactual explainers like '/Tabular/DicePublic' and '/Tabular/DisCERN', which users can utilize to generate counterfactual explanations."
