SHAP focuses on providing a unified measure of feature importance by considering all possible feature combinations, making it theoretically sound but computationally expensive. On the other hand, LIME approximates the model's behavior in the vicinity of a specific instance using perturbations of input data, which makes it generally faster and less prone to overfitting compared to SHAP."

The images shown include the original image and three neighbors, each with a similarity score and prediction value. This helps in understanding how the AI system perceives similarity and makes predictions based on visual features.\\n\\nIn the Isee Platform, you can explore various explainers that provide insights into image classification tasks. For instance, the '/Images/RISE' explainer uses randomly masked versions of the input image to deduce critical areas, while the '/Images/HSIC' explainer assesses the dependence between the output and patches of the input. These explainers, among others, can help you understand the model's decision-making process by highlighting the most relevant pixels to the target class. You can try these explainers to gain a deeper understanding of how your AI system interprets images."
