In the ISee Platform, you can try out explainers like '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPLocal' for multivariate tabular data, which utilize SHAP values to provide insights into feature contributions.\\n\\nAdditionally, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular choice. It approximates the model locally with an interpretable model to explain individual predictions, which can be useful for understanding specific instances. The ISee Platform offers '/Tabular/LIME' for multivariate tabular data, which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance.\\n\\nBoth methods offer insights into the model's decision-making process and can complement the Grad-CAM explanation by providing a different perspective on feature importance."

SHAP is based on cooperative game theory and Shapley values, providing a unified measure of feature importance that considers all possible feature combinations, making it theoretically sound and consistent but computationally expensive. LIME focuses on local interpretability by approximating the model's behavior in the vicinity of a particular instance using perturbations of input data to train simpler models. This approach is generally faster than SHAP but may not provide as consistent results due to its reliance on local approximations."
