            "reasonability_score": "10" ,"explanation": "Precision and recall are important metrics used to evaluate the performance of an AI system, particularly in classification tasks. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It answers the question: 'Of all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?' High precision indicates a low false positive rate. Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the actual positives. It answers the question: 'Of all the instances that were actually positive, how many were predicted correctly?' High recall indicates a low false negative rate. These metrics relate to overall accuracy, which is the ratio of correctly predicted instances (both positive and negative) to the total instances.
