            "reasonability_score": "9" ,"explanation": "Integrated Gradients is a technique used to explain the predictions of machine learning models, particularly those that use deep neural networks. It works by calculating the contribution of each input feature to the model's final prediction. Imagine you have an image and want to understand which parts of the image are most important for the model to classify it correctly. Integrated Gradients does this by gradually changing the input image from a baseline (like a completely black image) to the actual image, calculating the contribution of each pixel along the way. This helps highlight which areas of the image are most influential in the model's decision-making process."
