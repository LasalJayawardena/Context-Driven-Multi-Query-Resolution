In the ISee Platform, you can try out explainers like '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPLocal' for multivariate tabular data, which utilize SHAP values to provide insights into feature contributions.\\n\\nAdditionally, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular choice. It approximates the model locally with an interpretable model to explain individual predictions, which can be useful for understanding specific instances. The ISee Platform offers '/Tabular/LIME' for multivariate tabular data, which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance.\\n\\nBoth methods offer insights into the model's decision-making process and can complement the Grad-CAM explanation by providing a different perspective on feature importance."
