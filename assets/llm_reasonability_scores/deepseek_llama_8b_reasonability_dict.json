            "reasonability_score": "8" , "explanation": "The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique provides a unified measure of feature importance, showing how each feature contributes to the prediction. This can help understand the impact of each feature on the model's decision. In the ISee Platform, you can try out explainers like '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPLocal' for multivariate tabular data, which utilize SHAP values to provide insights into feature contributions. Additionally, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) approximates the model locally with an interpretable model to explain individual predictions. The ISee Platform offers '/Tabular/LIME' for multivariate tabular data, which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance. Both methods offer insights into the model's decision-making process and can complement the Grad-CAM explanation by providing a different perspective on feature importance."

            "reasonability_score": "8" ,"explanation": "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are two popular methods for explaining machine learning models. SHAP provides additive importance scores based on Shapley values, making it suitable for both tree-based and machine learning models. LIME, on the other hand, creates simple, human-readable explanations by locally approximating the model around a specific instance using linear approximation. While SHAP offers precise and interpretable results, LIME focuses on generating more understandable but less detailed explanations."
