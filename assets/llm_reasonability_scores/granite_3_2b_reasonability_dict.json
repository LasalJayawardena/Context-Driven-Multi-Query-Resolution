            "reasonability_score": "9" , "explanation": "For your use case, another explanation method you might consider is the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique. SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance, showing how each feature contributes to the prediction. This can help you understand the impact of each feature on the model's decision. In the ISee Platform, you can try out explainers like '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPLocal' for multivariate tabular data, which utilize SHAP values to provide insights into feature contributions. Additionally, LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular choice. It approximates the model locally with an interpretable model to explain individual predictions, which can be useful for understanding specific instances. The ISee Platform offers '/Tabular/LIME' for multivariate tabular data, which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance. Both methods offer insights into the model's decision-making process and can complement the Grad-CAM explanation by providing a different perspective on feature importance."

SHAP is based on cooperative game theory and Shapley values, providing a unified measure of feature importance and considering all possible feature combinations. It can be computationally expensive but offers global and local interpretability. LIME focuses on local interpretability by approximating the model with a simpler, interpretable model around a specific prediction using perturbations of the input data. It is generally faster than SHAP but may not provide as consistent results due to its reliance on local approximations."

Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It answers the question: 'Of all the instances that were predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?' High precision indicates a low false positive rate. Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the actual positives. It answers the question: 'Of all the instances that were actually positive, how many were predicted correctly?' High recall indicates a low false negative rate. These metrics relate to overall accuracy, which is the ratio of correctly predicted instances (both positive and negative) to the total instances. While accuracy gives a general idea of the model's performance, precision and recall provide deeper insights, especially in imbalanced datasets where one class may dominate. Balancing precision and recall is crucial, and this is often done using the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances both concerns."
