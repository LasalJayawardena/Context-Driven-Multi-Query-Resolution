            "reasonability_score": "10" ,"explanation": "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are both methods used to explain the predictions made by machine learning models. The main differences between them are:\n\n1. **Methodology**: SHAP is based on cooperative game theory, using Shapley values to attribute importance to each feature in a prediction. LIME, on the other hand, creates an interpretable model (usually a linear regression) locally around the instance being explained.\n\n2. **Global vs Local Interpretability**: SHAP provides both global and local interpretability, giving insights into the overall model behavior as well as individual predictions. LIME primarily focuses on local interpretability, explaining the prediction for a specific input instance.\n\n3. **Computational Complexity**: SHAP can be computationally expensive due to its consideration of all possible feature combinations. LIME is generally faster since it does not evaluate all combinations and instead approximates the model locally.\n\n4. **Approximation**: LIME approximates the complex model with a simpler one (e.g., linear regression) in the vicinity of the instance being explained, which might lead to less consistent results across different instances compared to SHAP. SHAP provides more consistent explanations but at a higher computational cost.\n\nIn the ISee Platform, you can find SHAP-based explainers like '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' for global feature influence and '/Tabular/TreeSHAPLocal' for local feature influence. For LIME-based explainers, there is '/Tabular/LIME', which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for a given instance.\n\nBoth methods aim to improve the transparency and understanding of AI models, but the choice between them depends on your specific needs for interpretability and computational resources. Experimenting with these explainers in the ISee Platform will help you better understand their functionalities."
