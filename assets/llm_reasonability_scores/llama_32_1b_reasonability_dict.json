The Grad-CAM explanation provided a clear and concise overview of the model's decision-making process, and the SHAP explanation offered a different perspective on feature importance. The LIME explanation was also helpful in understanding the model's decision-making process. However, the system could have provided more detailed information about the specific features used in the model. Overall, the system's responses were well-structured and easy to understand, and it provided a good balance of different explanations for the user to consider."
