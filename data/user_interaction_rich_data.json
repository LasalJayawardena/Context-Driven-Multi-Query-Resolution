The ISee Platform offers '/Tabular/LIME' for multivariate tabular data, which perturbs input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance.\n\n  Both methods offer insights into the model's decision-making process and can complement the Grad-CAM explanation by providing a different perspective on feature importance.\n</div>"}, {"llm_history": "placeholder history"}, {"clarification_node_id": "clarification_da54b34b-2a32-4f13-9470-a847274f40c0"}]]}, "chat_history_2024-12-11_08-07-05": {"usecase_name": "Sensor Anomaly Detection (Bosch)", "explainers_used": ["/Images/SSIMNearestNeighbours"], "bt_interaction_list": [["Yes", "Good Morning \u2600\ufe0f!<br>I am the iSee Chatbot for Sensor Anomaly Detection (Bosch), Would you like to proceed?", ["Yes", "No"]], ["<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">Auditor</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: Novice</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Proficient</p></div>", "I would like to know a more about your knowledge of the system, can you select a user group from below that best describes you?", ["<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">Auditor</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: Novice</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Proficient</p></div>", "<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\"> ML Engineer</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: Expert</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Novice</p></div>"]], ["I will use sampling", "<p>Would you like to upload a data instance (.jpg, .png) or use inbuilt sampling method to select a data instance for testing?</p>", ["I would like to upload", "I will use sampling"]], [null, "<p>Here is your test instance:</p><img width=\"400\" <Base64-Encoded-Image-Content\"/><br><p>And here is the outcome from the AI system:</p><div class=\"target-prediction\"><table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>NOK</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0.993</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table></div>", ["Okay"]], ["Which features need changed to get a different outcome?", "Please select a question below to indicate your explanation need", ["Which features need changed to get a different outcome?"]], [null, "<p>Here is an explanation from  S S I M Nearest Neighbours Technique</p><img <Base64-Encoded-Image-Content\"/><br><p><strong>Explanation Description:</strong> <br>This explanation presents the nearest neighbours of the query using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

This method helps to understand which parts of the input image contributed most to the AI system's prediction. The image on the left shows the original input, while the image on the right highlights the attributions for the target class. The color intensity indicates the importance of different regions in the image for the prediction, with brighter areas having a higher impact.\n\nIn addition to Integrated Gradients, the Isee Platform offers several other explainers that can be used to understand image predictions. For instance, the '/Images/GradientInput' method is a gradient-based technique that computes attributions by taking the partial derivatives of the output with respect to the input and multiplying them with the input itself. This method is designed to improve the sharpness of attribution maps.\n\nUsers can also explore the '/Images/SmoothGrad' explainer, which averages the gradient at several points corresponding to small perturbations around the point of interest, helping to reduce visual noise and improve explanations. Similarly, '/Images/SquareGrad' and '/Images/VarGrad' offer alternative approaches by averaging the square of the gradient and returning the variance of the gradient, respectively.\n\nThese explainers are available on the Isee Platform, and users are encouraged to try them out to gain deeper insights into their model predictions.\n</div>"}, {"llm_history": "placeholder history"}, {"clarification_node_id": "clarification_8747b8ac-9ec1-498d-98ad-269e11e0476a"}]]}, "chat_history_2025-01-06_02-26-15": {"usecase_name": "Loan Approval System", "explainers_used": ["/Tabular/DisCERN", "/Tabular/LIME"], "bt_interaction_list": [["Yes", "Good Morning \u2600\ufe0f Designer1!<br>I am the iSee Chatbot for Loan Approval System, Would you like to proceed?", ["Yes", "No"]], ["<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">User</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: No knowledge</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Novice</p></div>", "I would like to know a more about your knowledge of the system, can you select a user group from below that best describes you?", ["<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">User</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: No knowledge</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Novice</p></div>"]], ["I will use sampling", "<p>Would you like to upload a data instance (.csv) or use inbuilt sampling method to select a data instance for testing?</p>", ["I would like to upload", "I will use sampling"]], [null, "<p>Here is your test instance:</p><div class=\"target-prediction\"><table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>annual_inc</th>\n      <th>home_ownership</th>\n      <th>installment</th>\n      <th>int_rate</th>\n      <th>loan_amnt</th>\n      <th>purpose</th>\n      <th>term</th>\n      <th>total_pymnt</th>\n      <th>total_rec_int</th>\n      <th>verification_status</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>98000</td>\n      <td>RENT</td>\n      <td>358.88</td>\n      <td>17.47</td>\n      <td>10000</td>\n      <td>other</td>\n      <td>36 months</td>\n      <td>2153.49</td>\n      <td>1037.55</td>\n      <td>Not Verified</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table></div><br><p>And here is the outcome from the AI system:</p><div class=\"target-prediction\"><table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th>Rejected</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>0.98</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table></div>", ["Okay"]], ["Is this instance a common occurrence?", "Please select a question below to indicate your explanation need", ["Which feature contributed to the current outcome?", "Is this instance a common occurrence?"]], [null, "<p>Here is an explanation from  Dis C E R N Technique</p><table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">   <thead>     <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">       <th></th>       <th>loan_amnt</th>       <th>total_pymnt</th>       <th>total_rec_int</th>       <th>term</th>       <th>int_rate</th>       <th>installment</th>       <th>home_ownership</th>       <th>annual_inc</th>       <th>verification_status</th>       <th>purpose</th>       <th>loan_status</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <th>0</th>       <td>10000.0</td>       <td>2153.490000</td>       <td>1037.55</td>       <td>36 months</td>       <td>17.47</td>       <td>358.88</td>       <td>RENT</td>       <td>98000.0</td>       <td>Not Verified</td>       <td>other</td>       <td>Rejected</td>     </tr>     <tr>       <th>1</th>       <td>10000.0</td>       <td>10083.479131</td>       <td>1037.55</td>       <td>36 months</td>       <td>17.47</td>       <td>358.88</td>       <td>RENT</td>       <td>98000.0</td>       <td>Not Verified</td>       <td>other</td>       <td>Accepted</td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table><br><br><p><strong>Explanation Description:</strong> <br>An html page containing a table with the generated couterfactuals.</p>", ["Okay"]], [null, "Would you like an elaboration on the existing explanation or a different query regarding other explainers in Isee? \n Please Type in your Question in the below text box", null], ["Which feature contributed to the current outcome?", "Please select a question below to indicate your explanation need", ["Which feature contributed to the current outcome?", "I don't have any more questions"]], [null, "<p>Here is an explanation from  L I M E Technique</p><img <Base64-Encoded-Image-Content\"/><br><p><strong>Explanation Description:</strong> <br>An image contaning a plot with the most influent features for the given instance.

In the Isee Platform, you can try out explainers like '/Tabular/Importance' for tabular data or '/Images/HSIC' for image data to see feature influence explanations.\n\n2. **Decision Trees**: Visual representations of the decision-making process can be useful. They show the path taken by the AI to reach a conclusion, making it easier to follow the logic. While specific decision tree visualizations are not mentioned, the Isee Platform offers various feature relevance explainers that can aid in understanding model decisions.\n\n3. **Rule-Based Explanations**: These provide a set of rules or conditions that the AI uses to make decisions. It's a straightforward way to understand the criteria for different outcomes. The Isee Platform includes rule-based explainers like '/Misc/AIModelPerformance' that extract performance metrics from case structures.\n\n4. **Counterfactual Explanations**: As seen in the images, these show what changes would lead to a different outcome. They are useful for understanding the boundaries of decision-making. The Isee Platform offers counterfactual explainers such as '/Tabular/DicePublic' and '/Tabular/DisCERN' for generating diverse counterfactuals.\n\n5. **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts can help in visualizing data patterns and AI predictions, making complex information more accessible. The Isee Platform provides visualization explainers like '/Images/Sobol' and '/Images/RISE' for image data, which highlight relevant features.\n\nEach method offers a unique perspective and can be chosen based on the specific needs and preferences of the user.

The ISee Platform includes explainers such as '/Tabular/NICE' and '/Tabular/DicePublic' that generate counterfactuals for multivariate tabular data.</li>\n    \n    <li><strong>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):</strong> SHAP values provide a unified measure of feature importance, showing the contribution of each feature to the prediction. This method is based on cooperative game theory and can offer insights into the model's behavior. The ISee Platform supports SHAP-based explainers like '/Tabular/TreeSHAPGlobal' and '/Tabular/DeepSHAPGlobal' for ensemble and TensorFlow models, respectively.</li>\n    \n    <li><strong>LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):</strong> LIME explains individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model. It helps in understanding the model's decision for specific instances. The ISee Platform provides LIME explainers such as '/Text/LIME' for text data and '/Tabular/LIME' for tabular data.</li>\n    \n    <li><strong>Visualizations:</strong> Graphical representations such as decision trees, heatmaps, or word clouds can make complex data more accessible and easier to interpret. The ISee Platform offers visualization explainers like '/Images/Sobol' and '/Images/RISE' that highlight important image regions contributing to predictions.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  Each of these methods has its strengths and can be chosen based on the specific needs and preferences of the user.

These keywords are important features that the AI system considered in its analysis. For instance, \"fibre\" has a high score of 0.659, indicating its significance in the context.\n\n  3. **Keywords in Similar Texts**: The explanation also provides keywords used in similar texts for each class. This helps in understanding how the AI system differentiates between classes based on the presence of these keywords.\n\n  4. **Overlapping Words**: The explanation highlights words that overlap with similar texts for each class.

This technique highlights the important features that the AI system considers when making its prediction. The left side of the second image shows the original sensor image, while the right side visualizes the attributions for the class \"OK,\" indicating which parts of the image were most influential in the AI's decision.\n\nIn the ISee Platform, we have several explainers that can be used to understand image-based predictions. For instance, the Integrated Gradients technique is similar to the '/Images/GradientInput' explainer, which computes attributions by taking the partial derivatives of the output with respect to the input and multiplying them with the input itself. This method helps in improving the sharpness of the attribution maps.\n\nAdditionally, other explainers like '/Images/SmoothGrad' and '/Images/VarGrad' offer gradient-based explanations by averaging the gradient or its variance at several points, which helps in reducing visual noise and improving the clarity of explanations. These explainers are available on the ISee Platform, and users can try them out to gain deeper insights into their AI models.\n</div>"}, {"llm_history": "placeholder history"}, {"clarification_node_id": "clarification_8747b8ac-9ec1-498d-98ad-269e11e0476a"}]]}, "chat_history_2025-01-14_14-03-28": {"usecase_name": "Telecom notes diagnosis (BT)", "explainers_used": ["/Text/LIME"], "bt_interaction_list": [["Yes", "Good Afternoon Tim Sanmoogan!<br>I am the iSee Chatbot for Telecom notes diagnosis (BT), Would you like to proceed?", ["Yes", "No"]], ["<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">ML engineer</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: Expert</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Proficient</p></div>", "I would like to know a more about your knowledge of the system, can you select a user group from below that best describes you?", ["<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">ML engineer</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: Expert</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Proficient</p></div>", "<div class=\"persona\"><p class=\"persona-name\">Telecom Planner</p><p class=\"persona-prop\">AI Knowledge Level: Novice</p> <p class=\"persona-prop\">Domain Knowledge Level: Expert</p></div>"]], ["I will use sampling", "<p>Would you like to upload a data instance?</p>", ["I would like to upload", "I will use sampling"]], [null, "<p>Here is your test instance:</p>I cannot complete this task because Dp 160 pole needs replac ement to add new drop wire! fluidity has raised an activity 25 and passed to Assit assurance!

LIME helps in understanding which parts of the input data are most influential in the model's decision-making process.\n\nIn the ISee Platform, we have an explainer named '/Text/LIME' that provides a similar feature influence explanation for text data. This explainer perturbs the input data samples to train a simple model that approximates the prediction for the given instance and similar ones.
